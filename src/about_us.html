                Welcome to Pessie Mittelman’s Blog—a dedicated space where we demystify the complex world of cybersecurity,with a
                special focus on the evolution of ransomware. Here, we explore everything from the early days of ransomware,
                with its initial forms emerging in the late 1980s, to the sophisticated, high-stakes attacks of today that
                target individuals, businesses, and government systems alike. Our mission is to educate and empower our readers
                by breaking down technical concepts into clear, relatable insights, and by offering practical advice on
                protecting yourself in an increasingly digital world. Whether you’re a student, a professional, or just someone
                keen on understanding how cyber threats evolve and spread, our blog is your go-to resource for staying informed
                and proactive in the fight against cybercrime.
